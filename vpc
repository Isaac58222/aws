Virtual Private Cloud
@ our private area in the cloud

pre requiresite
IP adress
@ Internet protocol(IP) unigue name given to the machine
@ one ip can not be given to two machine 
eg. one aadar card number can not given for indians
@ RULE: 
      1. should be number.number.number.number
         eg. 10.12.143.20
      2. each number should 0 to 255
      3.as considering the privzte ip we now want to assign ip from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 to make computer understand this by CIDR
      @ private ip !) not expose to pubilc internet 2) used with in the organizarion
 CIDR
    1. classless inter domain routing
    2. we can assign ip from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 to make computer understand by 10.0.0.0/24, which has 256 ip but how?
    3.CIDR stats from /32 eg . 10.0.0.0/32 lets check how
    ip              from       upto     total ip
    10.0.0.0/32 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.0  total = 1
    10.0.0.0/31 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.1  total = 2
    10.0.0.0/30 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.3  total = 4
    10.0.0.0/29 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.7  total = 8
    10.0.0.0/28 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.15  total = 16
    10.0.0.0/27 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.31  total =32 
    10.0.0.0/26 -> 10.0.0.0-  10.0.0.63  total = 64
    10.0.0.0/25 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127  total = 128
    10.0.0.0/24 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255  total = 256  
    hence we can see 10.0.0.0/24  has the range 10.0.0.255 with total of 256 ip
    
    now what happen for /23
    10.0.0.0/24 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255  total = 256  after
    10.0.0.0/23 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.511  total = 512 may looks like correct but ip should not more than 255 
    so the correct answer is
    10.0.0.0/23 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.1.255  total = 512 ,but how
     consider you are going to a grand show
     there in  row 0, 256 people can sit from numer 0 to 255
     what where will people will sit after that, from row 1 ,0 to 255 
     consider the same now afer 10.0.0.255 IP  can seated from 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.0.255
     also we can imagaine that row 1 also filled as we have 512 people hence
     10.0.0.0/23 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.1.255 is correct
    alggorithm to find number of ip with cidr
    for /24 eg.192.10.0.0/24 => 32 - 24 = 8 => 8 power 2 = 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 256
    
    
    
    10.0.0.0/31 -> 10.0.0.0 10.0.0.1  total = 2
    10.0.0.0/31 -> 10.0.0.0 10.0.0.1  total = 2
