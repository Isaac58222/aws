Virtual Private Cloud
@ our private area in the cloud

pre requiresite
IP adress
@ Internet protocol(IP) unigue name given to the machine
@ one ip can not be given to two machine 
eg. one aadar card number can not given for indians
@ RULE: 
      1. should be number.number.number.number
         eg. 10.12.143.20
      2. each number should 0 to 255
      3.as considering the privzte ip we now want to assign ip from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 to make computer understand this by CIDR
      @ private ip !) not expose to pubilc internet 2) used with in the organizarion
 CIDR
    1. classless inter domain routing
    2. we can assign ip from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 to make computer understand by 10.0.0.0/24, which has 256 ip but how?
    3.CIDR stats from /32 eg . 10.0.0.0/32 lets check how
    ip              from       upto     total ip
    10.0.0.0/32 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.0  total = 1
    10.0.0.0/31 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.1  total = 2
    10.0.0.0/30 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.3  total = 4
    10.0.0.0/29 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.7  total = 8
    10.0.0.0/28 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.15  total = 16
    10.0.0.0/27 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.31  total =32 
    10.0.0.0/26 -> 10.0.0.0-  10.0.0.63  total = 64
    10.0.0.0/25 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127  total = 128
    10.0.0.0/24 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255  total = 256  
    hence we can see 10.0.0.0/24  has the range 10.0.0.255 with total of 256 ip
    
    now what happen for /23
    10.0.0.0/24 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255  total = 256  after
    10.0.0.0/23 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.511  total = 512 may looks like correct but ip should not more than 255 
    so the correct answer is
    10.0.0.0/23 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.1.255  total = 512 ,but how
     consider you are going to a grand show
     there in  row 0, 256 people can sit from numer 0 to 255
     what where will people will sit after that, from row 1 ,0 to 255 
     consider the same now afer 10.0.0.255 IP  can seated from 10.0.1.0 to 10.0.0.255
     also we can imagaine that row 1 also filled as we have 512 people hence
     10.0.0.0/23 -> 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.1.255 is correct
    
    algorithm to find number of ip with cidr
    for /24 eg.192.10.0.0/24 => 32 - 24 = 8 => 8 power 2 = 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 256
   
   pubilc ip = world wide 1 as a unique numer
    eg. gmail one gmail as the selected name no one cant get the same email
   private ip = can we same but in differnt organization eg google private 173 10.5.9.0 aws private ip 173.5.9.0
   eg. username of instagram and username of twitter came be same
   
   subnet mask
   ip adress consist of two parts 
     1. network adress
       adress given to a network eg .192.168.1.0
     2. host adress
        adress given within that network eg. computer (192.168.1.1),mobile (192.168.1.2)
     computer only understand binary numbers 1 and 0 
     for ip 192.168.1.0 (11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000)
     for subnet 255.225.255.0 (11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000) but how ?
      for that we have 8 bit octet chart which has 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1 = 255 (8 bits)
      for 192.168.1.0 for 192 we want to find addition of which of there will the result in 192
      wecan take 128+ 64 = 192 
      here we have to consider 1 if there is added and 0 if not
      so for 128 = 1, 64 = 1 , 32 = 0, 16 = 0, 8 = 0, 4 = 0, 2 = 0, 1 = 0 => 11000000 next
      for 168 128+32+8 = 168
       so 128 = 1, 64 = 0 , 32 = 1, 16 = 0, 8 = 1, 4 = 0, 2 = 0, 1 = 0 => 10101000 next
      for 1 ,1
      so 128 = 0, 64 = 0 , 32 = 0, 16 = 0, 8 = 0, 4 = 0, 2 = 0, 1 = 1 => 00000001 next
      as 0 evering 0 so 128 = 0, 64 = 0 , 32 = 0, 16 = 0, 8 = 0, 4 = 0, 2 = 0, 1 =  => 00000000
      
      aslo for 255.255.255.0
      for 255 = 128+64+32+16+8+4+32+1 => 255 
      so 128 = 1, 64 = 1 , 32 = 1, 16 = 1, 8 = 1, 4 = 1, 2 = 1, 1 = 1 => 11111111 for all 255 are same so next
      for 0
      as 0 evering 0 so 128 = 0, 64 = 0 , 32 = 0, 16 = 0, 8 = 0, 4 = 0, 2 = 0, 1 =  => 00000000
      
      hence  for ip 192.168.1.0 (11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000) is the binary number
      hence for subnet 255.225.255.0 (11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000) isthe binary number
